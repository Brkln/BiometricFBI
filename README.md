# How is it working ? 


# How can it be used ?
I wouldn't be surprised that in the next 10 years, when recreating your passport, id card, for example, they would ask you for a sample of your voice saying differents words.
## Why ?
Merging all these informations, you can detect anybody on the earth. For example, a ransom voice message, they would just need to enter it in their databases and they would know exactly who you are.
